                <p>I am a 21-year-old IT student at LUT University. I am currently in the bachelor's degree phase, but I
                    plan to complete a master's degree and graduate with a master's degree in information technology.
                    During my studies, I have gained experience in e.g. creating databases with SQL, editing databases
                    with the PHP programming language, coding Java, python and C and creating HTML webpages. In
                    addition, I have experience in game development with the Unity game engine. Due to my experience in
                    customer service, I get along easily with people and help others in decision making.
