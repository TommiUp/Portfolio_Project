            I've always considered it important to know what a person is like, in addition to their background so here
            are
            some of my strengths as a person...

            <div class="strength strength-1">
                <h3>Communication and cooperation skills</h3>
                <p>I have been told that I am a good leader in projects because I get along with everyone and I
                    am usually the first to propose when making decisions. When working as a group, I think that it is
                    important to get everyone on board as quickly as possible and that is why I encourage others to come
                    forward and introduce themselves and also tell about their thoughts. I am always willing to hear
                    about how others think because it helps with decision making. As a person, I think that I am more
                    than happy to communicate with others and take part in collaborative tasks.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="strength strength-2">
                <h3>Adaptability and learning skills</h3>
                <p>I am always willing to learn new things and develop further so that I can be the best version of
                    myself and that is why I have received feedback from previous jobs that I am a quick learner and I
                    also adapt well to the work environment. I am a person that thinks that studies are just the
                    beginning and you will learn more than you could have ever imagined and that is why I strive to
                    adapt to all kinds of situations and learn something new from them.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="strength strength-3">
                <h3>Persistent and optimistic skills</h3>
                <p>As a person, I am optimistic about the things I face, and that optimism includes persistency. If I
                    encounter exhausting or difficult tasks, I approach them with a positive attitude and critical
                    thinking. Giving up is not an option for me because there is a solution to every problem and with
                    the right attitude they are usually found. I think that problems should be dealt with when they
                    arise before they pile up and that is why I am a person, who doesn't give up easily. </p>
